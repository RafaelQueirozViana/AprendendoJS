// Private properties are used to transform properties in a class as private.
// It's very useful because private properties can't be used outside the class.

// To create private properties you just should add # in the initial of the declaration

// Ex:

class User {
    #password;
}

// Other thing is:  we also can transform methods as private.
// Ex:

class User {
    #validUser() {

    } // private method
}
