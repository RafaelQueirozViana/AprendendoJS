Private properties are used to transform properties in a class as private.
It's very useful because private properties can't be used outside the class.

 To create private properties you just should add # in the initial of the declaration

 Ex:

class User {
    #password;
}

Other thing is:  we also can transform methods as private.
 Ex:

class User {
    #validUser() {

    } // private method
}

this method only can be used or specifyed in the class that it is inside. If you try to acess the private method or
property you will receive an error
