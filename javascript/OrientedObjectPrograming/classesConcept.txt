classes in javascript are used as a function of the object oriented programming. Therefore it is
used to do the code more cleaner

classes structure:

class NameOfClass {
    #password;
    name;
    constructor(name, wantedpassword) {
        this.name = name;
        this.password = wantedpassword;
    };
};
