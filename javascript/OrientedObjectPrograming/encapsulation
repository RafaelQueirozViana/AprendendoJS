Encapsulation is just the process of group related functions and variables together;

for example

instead of use separated systems like this:

const baseSalary = 30000;
const overtime = 10;
const rate = 20;

const calculateSalary = () => {
    return baseSalary * overtime / rate;
} 

in oop you should use and manipulate objects;

const employee = {
    baseSalary: 30000,
    overtime: 10,
    rate: 20,

    getWage() {
    baseSalary * overtime / rate
    } 
}

const salary = employee.getWage();
